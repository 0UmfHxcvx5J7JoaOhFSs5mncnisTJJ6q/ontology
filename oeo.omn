It is any system or substance that contains energy for conversion as usable energy later or somewhere else. This could be converted for use in, for example, an appliance or vehicle. Such carriers include springs, electrical batteries, capacitors, pressurized air, dammed water, hydrogen, petroleum, coal, wood, and natural gas."@en,

Class: Transformer

    Annotations: 
        <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115> "1. A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in a second coil. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications.
2. A transformer is a static machine used for transforming power from one circuit to another without changing frequency. This is a very basic definition of transformer. Since there is no rotating or moving part so transformer is a static device. Transformer operates on ac supply. Transformer works on the principle of mutual induction.
