# Open Energy Family - Open Energy Ontology (OEO)

Developing a common ontology for energy system analysis and scenarios.

## Introduction

The Open Energy Ontology (OEO) is a domain ontology of the energy-system modelling context. It is developed as part of the [Open Energy Family](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform). The OEO is published on github as open source software. The language used is the Manchester OWL Syntax, which was chosen because it is user-friendly for editing and viewing diffs of edited files. The OEO is still under development and not released yet. A steering committee was created to accompany the development, increase awareness of the ontology and include it in current projects.

## Scope of this ontology

This **domain** ontology is a joint effort to represent the energy-system modelling context based on standard terminologies used by human experts in this field of research. It is designed to improve transparency and facilitate comparability & transferability within the energy system modelling context. This ontology makes use of the Basic Formal Ontology ( [BFO](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki) )and its principles.

## Installation

The ontology can be downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology

To open the ontology the program [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) is recommended.

The complete ontology is found under src/ontology/oeo.omn. The OEO-owned modules can be seen in the src/ontology/edits folder, and imported modules are under src/ontology/imports.

## Contributing and developing
This is an interdisciplinary, open source project, help is always appreciated! 

The development of the ontology happens mainly on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology) and is supplemented by (online) developer meetings to review the progress and discuss more complicated topics. 

Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki) for information about the ontology, its standards, its best practice principles and on BFO classification.
 
The workflow is described in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Please check it out **before** you start working on this project. Points that are not clear in the file can be discussed in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/issues/new/choose).

## Teams tag
Experts in ontology engineering, economy and energy-system modelling work together to combine domain knowledge with knowledge about how an ontology should be designed.

If you have a specific question about ontology, modelling or economy (in context of the ontology), you can [tag](https://github.com/OmahaGirlsWhoCode/OmahaGirlsWhoCode/wiki/How-to-tag-someone-in-a-pull-request) one of these teams to notify its members that you need their feedback/help.
