How to test for inconsistent ontologies and unsatisfiable classes:

1. Open the ontology in Protege
2. Start Reasoner with Strg-R or with Reasoner->Start Reasoner
   Protege now informs you if the ontology is inconsistent and gives you the option to get explanations.
   This usually happens when Individuals have conflicting types.
3. Open the Class hierarchy (inferred) to see if there is a subclass of owl:Thing called owl:Nothing.
   Unsatisfiable classes will be subclasses of owl:Nothing. 
   This usually happens when there are mutliple, disjunct superclasses.
