How to test for inconsistent ontologies and unsatisfiable classes:

1. Open the ontology in Protege
2. Under the Reasoner menu, Select the reasoner you want to use (like 'HermiT 1.4.2.456'")
3. Start reasoner with Strg-R (Ctrl-R) or with menu Reasoner->Start reasoner
   Protege now informs you if the ontology is inconsistent and gives you the option to get explanations.
   This usually happens when Individuals have conflicting types.
4. The Class hierarchy will popup and let you see if there is a subclass of owl:Thing called owl:Nothing.
   Unsatisfiable classes will be subclasses of owl:Nothing. 
   This usually happens when there are mutliple disjoint superclasses.
5. Stop reasoner with menu Reasoner->Stop reasoner

Useful when fixing:
- Synchronise reasoner with menu Reasoner-> Synchronise reasoner instead of stopping and starting again
